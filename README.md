# Tiny MDE

A chill little Markdown composition interface for the Block Editor. Work-in-progress.

Intentionally slim to serve as a learning example to accompany an upcoming piece for [Roots.io](https://https://roots.io).

## Features

- makes it simple to compose with markdown.includes github mentions. emoji. `syntax highlighting`. 🤤

- CSS-in-JS library [astroturf](https://github.com/4Catalyzer/astroturf). A match made in heaven -- as it compiles to static, everyday CSS files, which gives us time to store the reference to the database for block validation. Get sassy with precss, do `@import`s, win the scope war. No runtime baggage.

- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) is a great way to manage a project configuration for something with the scope of a block.

- Accessible: No JS on the frontend, JSX-ally in the editor. 💪🏾
